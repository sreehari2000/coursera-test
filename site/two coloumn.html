		<p id="p1">Dark matter is a form of matter thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe and about a quarter of its total mass–energy density or about 2.241×10−27 kg/m3. Its presence is implied in a variety of astrophysical observations, including gravitational effects that cannot be explained by accepted theories of gravity unless more matter is present than can be seen.</p>
		<p id="p2">For this reason, most experts think that dark matter is abundant in the universe and that it has had a strong influence on its structure and evolution.</p>
